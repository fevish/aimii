- This project is based on the overwolf-electron sample app (NOT Overwolf Native).
- All code and configuration is for overwolf-electron, not native Overwolf.
- Game events and in-game overlays are confirmed to work in this setup.
- The existing sample app files are to be kept for reference on how to use overwolf-electron APIs, game events, and overlays.
- When building new features or the new app, use the sample files as reference only; new app code should be completely separate.
- Do not remove or modify the sample files unless explicitly requested; they serve as a working reference for overwolf-electron usage.
