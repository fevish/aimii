# Get Started

1. Download and install the [latest release](https://github.com/fevish/aimii/releases/latest)
2. The app will guide you through the onboarding process which simply involves setting your baseline "mouse travel" from your preferred game, in-game sensitivity for that game, and mouse dpi setting.
3. Start a game that we support, and the app will auto-detect the game and show you the suggested sensitivity setting using game-conversion formulas.   
4. _(Optional but appreciated <3)_ Let me know how it works for you in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Nj2Xj3W4eY). Or just drop by to say hi!

# What is aimii?

aimii is a mouse sensitivity "normalizer" for games (currently FPS games specifically).

### Normalizing your aim
Most FPS games use unique formulas and scaling ratios for mouse and controllers, so the same in-game sensitivity number can feel completely different from one game to the next, for example:

An in-game sensitivity of `0.5` in Valorant is approximately `1.591` in Counter-Strike 2.

For me personally, this difference breaks my muscle memory when switching between games and although I can typically manually get my sensitivity normalized to a point where it feels "pretty close", it's never perfect.

## Features

- **Real-time Game Detection:** Automatically detects when you're playing supported games
- **Cross-Game Sensitivity Conversion:** Convert your sensitivity settings between different games
- **Canonical Settings:** Set your preferred game and sensitivity as a baseline for conversions
- **Overlay Widget:** In-game overlay showing current sensitivity suggestions
- **Hotkey Support:** Toggle widget visibility with customizable hotkeys
- **Game Conversion Calculator** Users can calculate aim sensitivity conversions manually without launching a game

## My first solo project!
Hi, I'm fevish, a dev/designer/dad who's been a PC gamer my entire life, I've sank the most hours in competitive titles especially Counter-Strike (I've been playing since version 1.3 in 2001. Yes, I'm that old!). I also play a vast array of FPS titles. I've personally always preferred a consistent aim sensitivity when I play FPS titles, so I decided to create aimii.app for myself as both a tool, but also an "indie dev vibe code" challenge for myself.

Not to flex but just to give you an idea of my background, here are a few of my gaming achievements over the years:
- Supreme Master First Class (CSGO) (although some of my old CS friends swear I hit Global Elite for a few days but I don't fully recall)
- Diamond (Valorant)
- Many chicken dinners xD (PUBG)
- 11LP away from Diamond (LoL)

Thanks for the support, I'd love to [hear any feature requests or feedback](https://discord.gg/Nj2Xj3W4eY) on aimii.app! ❤️ @fevish
