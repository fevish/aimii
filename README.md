# Get Started

1. Download and install the [latest release](https://github.com/fevish/aimii/releases/latest)
2. Set your "canonical sensitivity setting" in the app by choosing your preferred: game, in-game sensitivity, and mouse DPI
3. Start a game that we support, and the app will auto-detect the game and show you the suggested sensitivity setting using game-conversion formulas.   
4. _(Optional but appreciated <3)_ Let me know how it works for you in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Nj2Xj3W4eY). Or just drop by to say hi!

# What is aimii?

aimii is a mouse sensitivity "normalizer" for games (currently FPS games specifically).

### Normalizing your aim
Most FPS games use unique formulas and scaling ratios for mouse and controllers, so the same in-game sensitivity number can feel completely different from one game to the next, for example:

An in-game sensitivity of `0.5` in Valorant is approximately `1.591` in Counter-Strike 2.

For me personally, this difference breaks my muscle memory when switching between games and although I can typically manually get my sensitivity normalized to a point where it feels "pretty close", it's never perfect.

## Features

- **Real-time Game Detection:** Automatically detects when you're playing supported games
