# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the aimii sensitivity converter app to be more modular, maintainable, and follow better architectural patterns. The current codebase has significant redundancy, deprecated code, and tightly coupled components that make it difficult to maintain and extend with new features.

The refactoring will focus on creating reusable, modular components while preserving all existing functionality and user experience. The goal is to establish a clean architecture that makes future feature development easier and reduces code duplication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Component Modularity

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modular, reusable components so that I can easily maintain and extend the application without code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing sensitivity calculations THEN the system SHALL use a single, centralized SensitivityCalculator component across all contexts (main window, widget, calculator modal)
2. WHEN handling user preference management THEN the system SHALL use a unified UserPreferences component that handles both onboarding and settings modification flows
3. WHEN displaying game information THEN the system SHALL use a reusable GameDisplay component that works in both main window and widget contexts
4. WHEN managing settings flow THEN the system SHALL use a single SettingsFlow component that adapts to different contexts (onboarding vs preferences)
5. WHEN handling data loading states THEN the system SHALL use consistent loading and error handling patterns across all components

### Requirement 2: Service Layer Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean service layer architecture so that business logic is centralized and easily testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing game data THEN the system SHALL use a single GamesService that handles all game-related operations
2. WHEN performing sensitivity conversions THEN the system SHALL use a unified SensitivityService that handles all conversion logic
3. WHEN managing user settings THEN the system SHALL use a centralized SettingsService with clear interfaces
4. WHEN detecting games THEN the system SHALL use a consolidated GameDetectionService that handles both GEP and custom detection
5. WHEN services need to communicate THEN they SHALL use well-defined interfaces and dependency injection patterns

### Requirement 3: State Management Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want predictable state management so that the application behavior is consistent and debugging is easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing application state THEN the system SHALL use React Context or custom hooks to avoid prop drilling
2. WHEN handling async operations THEN the system SHALL use consistent patterns for loading states, error handling, and data fetching
3. WHEN components need shared state THEN they SHALL access it through well-defined context providers
4. WHEN state changes occur THEN the system SHALL minimize unnecessary re-renders through proper memoization
5. WHEN managing form state THEN the system SHALL use reusable form handling patterns

### Requirement 4: Code Deduplication and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate redundant and unnecessary code so that maintenance is easier and bugs are reduced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing similar UI patterns THEN the system SHALL reuse common components instead of duplicating code
2. WHEN handling data transformations THEN the system SHALL use shared utility functions
3. WHEN managing IPC communication THEN the system SHALL use consistent patterns and shared handlers
4. WHEN implementing validation logic THEN the system SHALL use reusable validation functions
5. WHEN formatting data for display THEN the system SHALL use centralized formatting utilities
6. WHEN removing deprecated code THEN the system SHALL ensure no functionality is broken
7. WHEN establishing patterns THEN all similar implementations SHALL follow the same consistent approach

### Requirement 5: Improved Component Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-organized components so that I can quickly locate and modify specific functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing components THEN the system SHALL group related components in feature-based directories
2. WHEN creating new components THEN they SHALL follow consistent naming and structure conventions
3. WHEN implementing shared functionality THEN it SHALL be placed in appropriate shared directories
4. WHEN components have multiple responsibilities THEN they SHALL be split into smaller, focused components
5. WHEN components need configuration THEN they SHALL use clear, typed props interfaces

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent error handling so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in services THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to users
2. WHEN network operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle retries and fallbacks gracefully
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL show clear, actionable error messages
4. WHEN unexpected errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them appropriately for debugging
5. WHEN errors are recoverable THEN the system SHALL provide users with recovery options

### Requirement 7: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be responsive so that my workflow is not interrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering large lists THEN the system SHALL use efficient rendering techniques
2. WHEN performing calculations THEN the system SHALL cache results when appropriate
3. WHEN components re-render THEN the system SHALL minimize unnecessary computations
4. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
5. WHEN handling user input THEN the system SHALL debounce expensive operations

### Requirement 8: Maintainable Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a maintainable architecture so that adding new features doesn't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new games THEN the system SHALL require minimal code changes outside of data configuration
2. WHEN modifying UI components THEN changes SHALL not affect unrelated functionality
3. WHEN updating business logic THEN the changes SHALL be isolated to appropriate service layers
4. WHEN extending functionality THEN the system SHALL support it through well-defined extension points
5. WHEN refactoring code THEN the existing public APIs SHALL remain stable

### Requirement 9: Testing Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want testable code so that I can ensure reliability and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing business logic THEN it SHALL be easily unit testable
2. WHEN creating components THEN they SHALL be designed for component testing
3. WHEN using external dependencies THEN they SHALL be mockable for testing
4. WHEN implementing complex flows THEN they SHALL be testable in isolation
5. WHEN services interact THEN their interfaces SHALL support dependency injection for testing

### Requirement 10: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want my existing settings and preferences to continue working so that I don't lose my configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactored app starts THEN it SHALL load existing user settings without data loss
2. WHEN migrating data structures THEN the system SHALL handle legacy formats gracefully
3. WHEN updating APIs THEN existing IPC interfaces SHALL remain functional
4. WHEN changing internal structures THEN user-facing behavior SHALL remain unchanged
5. WHEN deploying updates THEN users SHALL not need to reconfigure their settings
