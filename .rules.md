# AIMII Project Rules

## Overwolf Game ID Usage

**IMPORTANT**: When working with Overwolf game detection, always use `gameInfo.classId` for game identification, NOT `gameInfo.id`.

- `gameInfo.id` - Runtime instance ID (changes each time game launches, e.g., 216401)
- `gameInfo.classId` - Actual Overwolf game ID (static, matches games.json, e.g., 21640)

### Example:
```typescript
const activeGame = overlayService.overlayApi?.getActiveGameInfo();
const gameId = activeGame.gameInfo.classId; // ✅ Correct - use classId
const gameId = activeGame.gameInfo.id;      // ❌ Wrong - runtime instance ID
```

### Games.json Reference:
The `owGameId` field in `games.json` corresponds to Overwolf's `gameInfo.classId`.

## Project Structure

- This project is based on the overwolf-electron sample app (NOT Overwolf Native)
- All code and configuration is for overwolf-electron, not native Overwolf
- Game events and in-game overlays are confirmed to work in this setup
- The existing sample app files are kept for reference on how to use overwolf-electron APIs
- When building new features, use the sample files as reference only; new app code should be completely separate

## Styling Rules

- Never use inline styles in any code
- Always use external CSS, CSS modules, or the project's preferred styling method
